# Assignment 1C
## Compilation
Use `make clean` to clean the directory of previously compiled materials. Then, use `make` to compile .o files and raytracer1b.

## Notes
As you will see with example 7, my program does not render shadows onto triangles. I didn't see anything specific about it on the rubric, and since I was running short on time I have decided not to try to debug it on this version.
## Pictures for Showcase
Images that should be included in the showcase presentation are `showcase.png`
